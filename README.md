## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project was bootstrapped with the following technologies:

- Node.js (v22)
- npm

### Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Constantino/stewardbot
cd stewardbot
```

### Run the Backend

- To install the backend dependencies, `cd` into the backend folder and run `npm i`.
- Create your `.env` file (make sure it's gitignored) with this command `cp .env.sample .env`
- Fill in with your own API Keys for each required service
- Run the backend with `npm run dev`
- Now you can call each backend service with your favorite tool by calling `https://localhost:3001/api/v1/<service-name>`

### Run the Frontend

- To install the frontend dependencies, `cd` into the frontend folder and run `npm i`.
- Create your `.env` file (make sure it's gitignored) with this command `cp .env.sample .env`
- Fill in with your own API Keys for each required service
- Run the frontend with `npm run dev`
- You can now open a browser and navigate to `localhost:3000` to interact with the frontend

And that's it you can now run your backend and frontend of StewardBot locally!
